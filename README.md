## Coding and Design
Perfectionist. Design fanatic. I do code, occasionaly, mainly in HTML, JavaScript, and Python. Many of my projects will be related to the environment or to classical music. I'm always ready to give advice on design. If that triggers anybody, I can't help it.

## Other Interests
D. Shostakovich and JS. Bach lover. Violinist. Artist. Birder. Environmentalist. That is the reason for the fourth sentence of the section above. Left-liberal. Anti-communalist. If that triggers anybody, that's their problem
