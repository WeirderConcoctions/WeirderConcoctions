## Coding and Design
Perfectionist. Design fanatic. I do code, occasionaly, mainly in HTML, JavaScript, and Python. Many of my projects will be related to the environment or to classical music. I'm always ready to give advice on design.

## Other Interests
D. Shostakovich and JS. Bach lover. Violinist. Artist. Birder. Environmentalist. That is the reason for the fourth sentence of the section above. Left-liberal. Anti-communalist. If that triggers anybody, that's their problem. Much of my design work may be related to the said topics.
